* Snoopy calendar
  A Scheme rewrite of the infamous Snoopy calendar, which was
  originally written in 1960s. The shtick is that it picks a random
  year in the near past whose calendar matches this year's and
  displays that. (eg 1964 in 2020)

  Requires an R6RS conformant Scheme and SRFIs 1, 19 (to get the
  current date), 27 (to randomise past years) and 37 (to parse command
  line arguments).
