* Snoopy calendar
  A Scheme rewrite of the infamous Snoopy calendar, which was originally written
  in 1960s. The shtick is that it picks a random year in the near past whose
  calendar matches this year's and displays that. (eg 1964 in 2020)

  Requires SRFIs 1, 19 (to get the current date) and 27 (to randomise past
  years).

  Currently lacks actual Snoopy art because I don't know how to obtain that
  legally.
