* Snoopy calendar
  A Scheme rewrite of the infamous Snoopy calendar, which was originally written
  in 1960s. The shtick is that it picks a random year in the near past whose
  calendar matches this year's and displays that. (eg 1964 in 2020)

  Requires an [[http://www.r6rs.org/][R6RS]] conformant Scheme (although it could be trivially ported to
  [[https://small.r7rs.org/][R7RS Small]]) and SRFIs 1, 19 (to get the current date), 27 (to randomise past
  years) and 37 (to parse command line arguments).
